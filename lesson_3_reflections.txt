When would you like to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your workC

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If it works automaticly, i can push some unwanted changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks is a GitHub's feature, not Git's. It's like clonning repos btw GitHub accounts.
	Branch is like a directions copied on main road. 
	Clone is clone. na na naa nÄ± na.
